print f is called from <stdio.h>
stdout -> printF
print f makes a system call to the operating system

Heap memory is used for variables that use malloc. Parameters passed to malloc is the size of the area to be allocated in bytes
Free takes a pointer to allocated area of memory and deallocates the pointer for malloc
